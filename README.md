# HairsSort
Haris Sort is a stable, comparison-based sorting algorithm that improves upon Bubble Sort and Selection Sort by immediately swapping elements when a smaller value is found. Unlike Selection Sort, which selects the smallest element before swapping, Haris Sort swaps elements dynamically as it iterates, leading to fewer swaps and a stable order.
