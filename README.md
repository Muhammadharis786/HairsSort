# Haris Sort ðŸš€  
Haris Sort is a stable sorting algorithm that improves upon Bubble Sort and Selection Sort by swapping elements immediately instead of waiting for the smallest one.  

## ðŸ“Œ Features  
- âœ… **More efficient than Bubble Sort** (fewer swaps).  
- âœ… **More stable than Selection Sort** (preserves order of equal elements).  
- âœ… **Easy to implement and understand.**  

## ðŸ“œ Algorithm  
1. Iterate through the array with an **outer loop (`i`)**.  
2. Compare `arr[i]` with all elements ahead (`j = i + 1` to `n-1`).  
3. **Swap immediately** if a smaller value is found.  
4. Repeat until sorted.
